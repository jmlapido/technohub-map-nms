# Status Bar Redesign - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Redesigned the mini status area on the map to be a full docked status bar (not floating) with minimize/maximize functionality and interactive area focus features.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Full Docked Layout (Not Floating)**
- Changed from floating card overlay to a docked status bar at the bottom
- Uses flexbox layout: map takes `flex-1` and status bar uses `shrink-0`
- Map automatically adjusts height to accommodate the status bar
- Status bar is always visible (never completely hidden)

### 2. **Minimize/Maximize Toggle**
- **Minimized State**: Shows only the top bar with area statistics
- **Maximized State**: Expands to show full details including grouped areas and offline devices
- Button uses `ChevronUp`/`ChevronDown` icons from lucide-react
- No longer uses "Hide/Show" - always visible

### 3. **Top Bar Design**
Displays area types with online/offline counts:
```
Schools 2/5 | Vendo 3/3 | Homes 10/15 | Server/Relay 1/2  [Minimize/Maximize]
```
- Icons for each area type
- Green color for online count (emphasized with `font-semibold`)
- Gray color for total count
- Pipe separator (`|`) between types

### 4. **Clickable Area Names with Map Focus**
When maximized:
- Area names are rendered as clickable buttons
- Hover effect: background changes to `bg-muted`
- Clicking focuses the map on that area:
  - Uses `map.flyTo([lat, lng], 15)` with 1.5s animation
  - Zoom level: 15
  - Marker pulses for 3 seconds with animation

### 5. **Marker Pulse Animation**
- Added `pulse-marker` keyframe animation to `globals.css`
- Focused marker scales from 1 to 1.2
- Blue ripple effect using box-shadow
- Animation duration: 1s, infinite while focused
- Auto-clears after 3 seconds

### 6. **Offline Duration Display**
Changed from:
```
Device Name (5s)
```
To:
```
Device Name (Offline for 5s)
```

## Files Modified

### `frontend/components/NetworkMap.tsx`
- Added state: `statusPanelMaximized` (boolean), `focusedAreaId` (string | null)
- Added function: `focusOnArea(areaId: string)` - handles map focus and marker animation
- Updated `createCustomIcon()` to accept `isFocused` parameter
- Restructured layout: main div uses `flex flex-col`, map in `flex-1` container, status bar in `shrink-0` container
- Replaced floating status panel with docked status bar
- Made area names clickable buttons with `onClick={focusOnArea}`
- Updated offline duration format

### `frontend/app/globals.css`
- Added `@keyframes pulse-marker` animation
- Pulse effect with scale and box-shadow changes
- Blue ripple effect at 50% keyframe

## Component State Management

```typescript
const [statusPanelMaximized, setStatusPanelMaximized] = useState(false)
const [focusedAreaId, setFocusedAreaId] = useState<string | null>(null)
```

## Focus Animation Flow

1. User clicks area name → `focusOnArea(areaId)` called
2. Map flies to area coordinates with zoom 15
3. `focusedAreaId` state set → marker re-renders with `isFocused=true`
4. Marker shows pulse animation via CSS
5. After 3 seconds, `focusedAreaId` cleared → animation stops

## Layout Structure

```
<div flex flex-col>
  <div flex-1 (map container)>
    <MapContainer>
      ... map, markers, links ...
    </MapContainer>
    ... map controls (view toggle, area details panel) ...
  </div>
  
  <div shrink-0 (status bar)>
    <div (top bar - always visible)>
      Area type statistics | Minimize/Maximize button
    </div>
    
    {statusPanelMaximized && (
      <div (expanded content)>
        Grouped areas (clickable)
        Offline devices list
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
</div>
```
